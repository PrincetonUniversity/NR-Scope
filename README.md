NR-Scope
========

**NR-Scope** is a 5G wireless network telemetry tool for 5G Standalone network measurement and performance optimization.  NR-Scope decodes DCI, SIB and RACH information from a 5G Standalone (New Radio) base station.  It is distinct from [NG-Scope](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/NG-Scope), our prior 4G cellular network telemetry tool.

NR-Scope is [published](https://doi.org/10.1145/3680121.3697808) in ACM CoNEXT 2024: if you use this tool, we ask that you cite our paper and reach out to the developers at the email address `ng-scope-dev` *at* `lists.cs.princeton.edu`

NR-Scope and NG-Scope are open source products of NSF Award CNS-2223556 (IMR: MT).  Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

# Features

The main features are as follows:

1. Supports 5G SA cells with 15kHz and 30kHz SCS, tested with 10MHz, 15 MHz, 20MHz, 40MHz and 100MHz cell bandwidth.
2. Carrier aggregation decoding, NR-Scope would use one SDR to try to decode both carrier aggregated and not carrier aggregated UEs within the RAN. Tested in commercial T-Mobile 15MHz FDD and 100MHz TDD cells.
3. 5G SA cell search and MIB decoding.
4. SIB 1 and all other SIBs decoding.
5. RRCSetup (MSG 4) decoding for continuously UE attatch detection.
6. Threaded DCI decoding for detected UEs.
7. SIB, RRCSetup and DCI decoding are threaded for performance and independent processing.
8. Can concurrently decode up to 64 UEs (max number we can create with groundtruth) in the same base station. In T-Mobile cell, we can decode up to hundreds of UEs.
9. Accurate DCIs, PRB and bit rate estimation for each UEs (please stay tuned for our paper).
10. Local logging functions in `.csv` file and remote google BigQuery uploading function in BigQuery table.
11. Support using multiple USRPs to decode multiple base stations independently, each has its own log.
12. Cell search for all possible frequencies in a separate file and the results are stored in `.csv` log file.
13. Non-initial (BWP id > 0) and plaintext (configured in SIB 1 or MSG 4) BWPs decoding in separate DCI decoder threads.
14. Threaded resampling function for better-fidelity TwinRX USRP X310 daughterboard (better signal quality but doesn't support 5G sampling rate without resampling).
15. Worker pool function is implemented. Each worker works on the slot data asynchronously. Now the processing doesn't need to keep up with the short slot time, and the throughput is increase through more workers.
16. Stay tuned... ðŸ˜„

## Requirements

We tested this system on Ubuntu 22.04 system and it may support other version of Ubuntu. To build this project and make it run properly, the following libraries are needed.

[UHD libraries](https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_install.html):

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ettusresearch/uhd
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev uhd-host
```

[srsRAN_4G&#39;s requirements](https://docs.srsran.com/projects/4g/en/latest/general/source/1_installation.html):

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libfftw3-dev libmbedtls-dev libboost-program-options-dev libconfig++-dev libsctp-dev
```

[yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp):

```
# In a different directory
git clone https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git
cd yaml-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

We need [liquid-dsp](https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp) for resampling if better-fidelity TwinRX USRP X310 daughterboard is used:

```
# In a different directory
sudo apt-get install automake autoconf
# download source codes
git clone https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp.git
cd liquid-dsp
# Building and installing the main library
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
# to double check, libs should appear at /usr/local/lib and header liquid.h should appear at /usr/local/include/liquid/
```

For different USRP daughterboard, different `config.yaml` should be used. Please refer to the sample `config.yaml` in `./nrscope/config/config.yaml` and the explanatory comment in it.

CBX:

```
......
rf_args: "clock=external,type=x300,sampling_rate=23040000" #"type=x300" #"clock=external"
rx_gain: 30 # for x310, max rx gain is 31.5, for b210, it's around 80
srate_hz: 23040000 #11520000 #11520000 #23040000
srsran_srate_hz: 23040000
......
```

TwinRX (note TwinRX has a significantly higher rx gain limit):

```
......
rf_args: "clock=external,type=x300,master_clock_rate=200000000,sampling_rate=25000000" #"type=x300" #"clock=external"
rx_gain: 90 # for x310, max rx gain is 31.5, for b210, it's around 80
srate_hz: 25000000 #11520000 #11520000 #23040000
srsran_srate_hz: 23040000
......
```

Also, you should turn on the performance mode:

```
# This script is copied from srsRAN_Project
cd script
sudo ./srsran_performance
```

Push DCI logs to google storage BigQuery table (optional):
Using google client c++ library requires c++ 14.0, where in ubuntu 22.04, the default c++ version is 11.0. We thought that nobody wants to mess with the system compiling environments, so we implement the function of pushing data to google cloud storage with python. Here is a step-by-step instruction of how to push the DCI log to our google cloud storage:

```
1. sudo pip install google-cloud-storage geocoder
2. sudo gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account bigquery-writer@tutorial-explore.iam.gserviceaccount.com
3. # There will be a link from goole, open that link and login with any of your google account.
4. sudo gcloud init
5. # In the config file (./nrscope/config.yaml), set push_to_google: true.
6. # In the config file (./nrscope/config.yaml), set google_service_account_credential: "/home/wanhr/Downloads/nsf-2223556-222187-b5d2ea50f5d1.json" with the google service account credential file (provided by us)'s location on your file system.
7. # In the config file (./nrscope/config.yaml), set google_dataset_id: "ngscope5g_dci_log" with the google cloud Bigquery dataset name, everyone has his/her own dataset. The code will create one if the dataset with this dataset id is not existed.
8. sudo gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <Your Google Storage Project Name>
```
